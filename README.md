# Tinder Cards
Tinder Cards for UW The Daily's 2021 Sex Edition that link to each article through swiping.
The completed project can be found at The Daily's [website](https://www.dailyuw.com/special_sections/sex_edition_2021/). Each card links to a different article in the edition. As per the Tinder swiping functionality, swiping right or pressing the heart button will open the article. Swiping left or pressing the x will just remove the card. 

## Functionality
These Tinder cards were embedded in The Daily's backend which requires no separation of HTML, CSS, and JS, so all content is in one file using ```script``` and ```style``` tags. The styles and functionality though are condensed into a single tag. 
Note that swiping functionality and sizing is dependent on the size of the larger container that the cards are embedded in. These numbers are based on the container used in The Daily's final page.

This project used the [Hammer JS](https://hammerjs.github.io/dist/hammer.min.js) script as a basis for swiping functionality.
